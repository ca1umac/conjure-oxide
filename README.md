# Oxidelings

## Getting Started
There are 6 challenges. Switch to each branch in turn (e.g. 1-CLI), and read the instructions for that challenge in the `~INSTRUCTIONS` folder.

This is a shortterm project for me to gain experience with oxide from e2e. 
The goal is to take something that works, break it, and make it a task to fix it.

There are 6 projects:
1. CLI
2. Parser
3. Model
4. Rule Engine
5. Solver Adapter
6. Testing

Which follow oxide through its runtime. 

## CLI Project
**Objective**: Implement the `solve` command 

Other outcomes include learning about clap, traits, derive, impl, enums, and structs.


## Parser
**Objective**: Implement Find

Other outcomes include learning about the native parser, tree-sitter, B-Trees, idiomatic rust (`?`, `.expect()`)

## Model
**Objective**: Implement TBC (Literals?)

Other outcomes include learning about ground and unresolved domains, ...

## Rule Engine
**Objective**: Implement TBC (Bubble?)

## Solver Adapter
**Objective**: Implement TBC (partial part of minion? or build a small rust solver that takes little adaptation?)

## Testing
**Objective**: Add testing for everything implemented?
